# Why use ruby

## Goal

I want deploy a BDD acceptance testing for this project

## Python

At the very early state, the script is written in python.
So I start at Python, try to find a BDD solution with Python.
After a lot of searching, I come to [behave](https://github.com/behave/behave).
Then I need to find some pre defined steps to handle CLI testing.
I found
- [behave4cmd](https://github.com/jenisys/behave4cmd)
- [behave_cli](https://github.com/longaccess/longaccess-behave/tree/master/behave_cli/expect)

Both of them are incomplete, and it's not ready/easy to integrate.
